Inferential Statistics Project – Employee Performance Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of inferential statistics on a synthetic
employee performance dataset. The goal is to apply and understand statistical
hypothesis testing techniques using Python.

The dataset contains information about 300 employees, including department,
years of experience, performance score, salary, training status, promotion
status, and satisfaction rating. The data is randomly generated to simulate
real-world corporate data.

Statistical Tests Performed:

1. Z-Test
A one-sample Z-test is used to check whether the company’s average performance
score is significantly different from a national average performance score.

2. T-Test
An independent two-sample T-test is used to compare performance scores between
employees who completed training and those who did not.

3. Chi-Square Test
A chi-square test of independence is used to examine whether there is a
relationship between training completion and promotion.

4. ANOVA
One-way ANOVA is used to compare average salaries across different departments
(Sales, Marketing, IT, HR).
